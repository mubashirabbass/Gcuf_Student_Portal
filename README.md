# Gcuf_Student_Portal
  I developed a GCUF Student Portal in C++ as my semester project. The program features a user-friendly interface for managing student records with form validation (name, age, contact, etc.), department-specific program listings, and faculty menus. It showcases my skills in C++ programming, data handling, and creating interactive applications.
